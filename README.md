I've been a software engineer for more than 23 years. I am still actively writing code and emphasize continuous learning to keep up with ever-changing technology. I also enjoy creating partnerships with stakeholders to focus on product development and improvement. I do well working in fast-paced environments and am always excited to start new projects.

One of my favorite things to do is help teams analyze their current processes and then collaborate to build a product that increases flexibility and efficiency. A recent success was developing a web application that replaced the usage of 6 different tools to manage continuing education for healthcare providers. This project was so successful that it was licensed out to other Universities and I am credited as an inventor of the product.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new version of my templated [email management tool](https://github.com/craigmcampbell/Hermes-API)
- ðŸŒ± My current toolset includes Postgres, Node, React, GraphQL (Apollo), and Material UI
